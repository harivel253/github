<p>Prithvi is a short-range, surface-to-surface ballistic missile developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) of India. It is named after the Prithvi (meaning "Earth" in Sanskrit), the primary element of the five basic elements in Hindu mythology.

The Prithvi missile has a range of up to 350 km and can carry both conventional and nuclear warheads. It was first tested in 1988 and entered service with the Indian armed forces in 1994. The missile has undergone several upgrades since its introduction, and the latest version is known as Prithvi-II.

The Prithvi missile system is mobile, which allows it to be quickly deployed and moved to different locations, making it harder for an enemy to target. It is also highly accurate, with a circular error probable (CEP) of around 10-25 meters, depending on the version.

The Prithvi missile has been used extensively in Indian military exercises, and several variants of the missile have been developed, including the air-launched version, Prithvi Air Defence (PAD) system, and the naval version, Dhanush.
